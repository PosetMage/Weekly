## About Marketing
* Create [GPTs - Japanese Reading Helper (xhtml parser)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtNaplHDfs)

## About Game Creating

### Drawing Ability
* Krenz L3 done
* TODO: L4

## Algo Trading
* meeting for better script,
* TODO: subscribe tradingview start using robot
* Concepts:
  * AI can read graph, that is, venture capital can use ai to analysis
  * Investing usually need to way some condition of a strategy.
  * Static random probability loss/win is common, need accept loss almost everytime

## About life
* iterative better eating quality
* iter better doing content at gym
* iter better sleep and wake up time
* keep learning japanese

### About Futher tech
* Multi-view render such as photon mapping may use in MMOVR game
* GPTs just like iphone app
  * early developing will be replaced by official apps
  * need to find other way such as airbnb, uber this different dimension
* AIGC will make it's harder for small creators to rise because the big ones easily get bigger. 
  * Previously, music was refreshed with new voices, but now AI can sing with any voice. Once a singer licenses their voice to AI, new singers lose the chance to replace them.
  * The same goes for actors. With stars like Tom Cruise licensing their likeness to AI, new actors can't wait for their turn anymore.

### About Philosophy
* my new concept: right/wrong need context, when arguing, some people reject your context means your are right because the context works. and further, his/her context need reject also.
* due to AICG and art ai, people who drawing is really for hobby not for money anymore.

### About me
* TODO: change the mind that always prepare and not start, ex: keep waiting game engine updates, keep waiting AI improve, keep waiting algo trading script better.
* good mindmap updates

### future music AI
The text describes DALL-E 3 as a system where users communicate with GPT-4 to describe the image they want, instead of directly providing prompts to DALL-E. This might be inconvenient for some, especially those used to working with Midjourney or Stable Diffusion where they can specify certain objects in the image. However, the text highlights the importance of this approach in music AI, where a user can describe a type of music to GPT, which then instructs a music AI to create it. This is beneficial as most people cannot describe music technically but can reference a similar song, allowing AI to use terms like "Dorian scale" or "walking bass" to create music.

### art-music mapping

The text draws parallels between the development of painting and music, focusing on their core concepts:

1.  In painting, the key concepts are Perspective, Composition, and Color:
    
    *   Perspective is related to three-dimensional geometry.
    *   Composition involves the arrangement of points, lines, and planes, emphasizing dynamics.
    *   Color is about the study of colors, a field that has been deeply explored in modern painting styles.
2.  The development of these elements in painting occurred in a specific order: Perspective was fully developed first, while Color theory is a more recent and deeply explored aspect.
    
3.  In music, these concepts have analogs:
    
    *   Classical music is likened to Perspective in painting, requiring precise calculations and having a perfect theoretical structure (e.g., pieces that can be played backwards).
    *   Jazz and Blues focus on melody flow and rhythm, similar to the dynamic aspect of Composition in painting.
    *   Chord theory in music, which has been deeply developed only recently, is highlighted by mentioning Jacob Collier, known for his expertise in music theory.

This comparison highlights the evolution and depth of theory in both art forms, showing how each medium has its own complex set of rules and development history.

### build up new concepts
The text reflects on the challenges of concept formation, emphasizing that learning and acquiring concepts in a single field can be difficult. However, it points out that individuals who have studied in multiple disciplines may find it easier to transfer and apply concepts from one field to another. This cross-disciplinary approach can facilitate a deeper and more versatile understanding, enabling the application of knowledge and ideas from one area of study to enrich another.
